# CV

## [DEMO](https://cvpp-2bfc2.web.app/?highlight=.net,angular,sql)

## What did I use?
- Angular Signals (removed zone.js)
- Tailwind
- Firebase Hosting
- Firestore
- Firebase Authentication
- Firebase App Check
- Font Awesome
- Google Fonts
- crypto-js

I don't want my phone number to be public on the web, so I've stored it in the Firestore database. 
Requests have been secured using Firebase Authentication and App Check (reCAPTCHA 3).
